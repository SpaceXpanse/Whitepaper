Imagine a time and place where one with some development skills can create a whole metaverse for himself. Or for one’s brand. Or some company’s project. Or just create a whole metaverse for the Star Trek’s fans. And it can be filled with whatever one’s want — friends, planets, space stations, ships, islands, castles, vehicles, etc. And it’s possible to jump from one’s to other people’s metaverses with the ease of just taking a step or open a door. This will be the **multiverse of the future**. Stop imagining it. It is almost here and now. _The future now_.
