# Manifesto
### To set the intentions    

**Long story short**: By regaining some cutting-edge technologies' true purpose, we want to make a self-sustained virtual environment, where everyone can communicate, develop and entertain himself and which can be easily accessed from everywhere aka **SpaceXpanse Multiverse**. It is a next-gen trustless blockchain platform, made for quick creation of metaverses, immersive user experience and convenient development of complex decentralized applications.

## SpaceXpanse Multiverse aka SpeX platform environment: 

### Technologies 
**ROD Blockchain**  
Open source  
Non-profit - Foundation operated
- Currency, fungible and nonfungible tokens
- Digital IDs and other information, stored in the blockchain

- Gravitational and other forces, affecting all objects accordingly /physics/
- Fast rendering with realistic level of detail
- Creation and editing of multi-part and multi-seated usable objects
- Python API for modeling of scientific inquiries
- Scenario programing /Lua/ 
- Node-based programming logic /like UE5/
- Easy adding of new solar systems, planets and satellites

**Different develoment tools /TBA/**  
Open source  
Non-profit - Foundation operated  
- To help developers have useful environment for effortless creation of metaverses and/or DApps in the platform  

### Community

**SpeXID**  
Open source  
Non-profit - Foundation operated
