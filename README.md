# Manifesto
### To set the intentions    

**Long story short**: By regaining some cutting-edge technologies' true purpose, we want to make a self-sustained virtual environment aka **SpaceXpanse Multiverse** where everyone can communicate, develop and entertain himself and which can be easily accessed from everywhere.

## SpaceXpanse Multiverse aka SpeX platform environment: 

### Technology  
**ROD Blockchain**  
Open source  
Non-profit - Foundation operated
- Currency, fungible and nonfungible tokens
- Digital IDs and other information, stored in the blockchain
- Atomic trading
- Decentralized DNS aka dDNS /from Namecoin/
- Decentralized blockchain database through Decentralized Proof of Stake aka DPoS masternodes and peer-to-peers data miners
- Programable interconnection between the blockchain and third-party applications

### Development  
**SpaceXpanse Metaverse Simulator**  
Open source  
Non-profit - Foundation operated

- Real-time realistic solar system with major celestial bodies, terrains and environment
- Gravitational and other forces, affecting all objects accordingly /physics/
- Fast rendering with realistic level of detail
- Creation and editing of multi-part and multi-seat objects
- Python API for modeling of scientific inquiries
- Scenario programing /Lua/ 
- Node-based programming logic /like UE5/
- Easy adding of new solar systems, planets and satellites

### Community  
**Metalog Social Network**  
Open source  
Non-profit - Foundation operated
- Full-blown Decentralized Social Network usable within every platform's metaverse and/or DApp

**MetaDAO**  
Open source  
Non-profit - Foundation operated
- Full-blown Decentralized Autonomous Organisation application to serve as crowdfunding hub for user's projects within the platform

### Entertainment  
**SpaceXpanse: Wanderers** metaverse
Closed source Real-time Massive Multiplayer Open World Sandbox game with realistic look, physics and economics  
For-profit - Legal entity operated
- Developed on top of SpaceXpanse: Sol platform. 
- Partly closed source /GSP and game logic/
- Made in Unreal Engine 5
- In-game communication in real time /through deSoNet/
- Voice-operated commands
- NFTs for ownership of land, objects and goods
- Massive near-real economy
- Decentralized AIs for automatization of mining, defence and communication /TBD/
- Creation and customization of avatars
- VR gameplay for mobile phones
- Possibility for real-time monitoring and customization of story arcs /scenario injection/
 
#### The Voyagers Chapter
Where users can explore the solar system and have access to limited missions /sandbox for the next chapter/ 

#### The Prospectors Chapter
Where users can also claim land, dig its resources, build multi-part objects and do limited trade with them /sandbox for the next chapter/

#### The Merchants Chapter
Where users can also buy, lend and sell what they want in near-real economy 

#### Infinity Chapter
Warp drive invention to explore Milky Way galaxy and beyond.
