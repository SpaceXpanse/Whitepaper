# SpaceXpanse /SpeX/ Manifesto
### A set of intentions    

Long story short: We want to make a self-sustained virtual environment by using cutting-edge technologies, which can be easily accessed by everyone from everywhere 

## Environment: 

### Blockchain - ROD
Open source

- Main currency /creation of tokens/
- Storage of Digital IDs and other information
- Decentralized DNS or dDNS /from Namecoin code/
- Storage of files by implementation of IPFS

### Community - deSoNet /dSN/
Open source

- Full-blown Decentralized Social Network

### Research - Sol Project
Open source

- Real-time realistic solar system with major celestial bodies, terrains and environment
- Gravitational and other forces, affecting all objects accordingly /physics/
- Fast rendering with realistic level of detail
- Creation and editing of multi-part objects
- Python API
- Node-based programming logic /like UE5/
- Multiple seats in one object
- Scenario programing /lua/
- Adding of new solar systems, planets and satellites by users

### Entertainment - SpaceXpanse Wanderers game
Closed source Real-time Massive Multiplayer Open World Sandbox game with realistic look, physics and economics 

- Developed on top of Sol Project
- Partly closed source /GSP and game logic/
- Made in Unreal engine 5 and Vulkan
- Communication in real time / through deSoNet by invention of FTL communication principle/
- Voice-operated
- NFTs for ownership of land, objects and goods
- Massive near-real economy
- Decentralized AI for automatization of mining, defence and communication 
- Creation and customization of avatars
- VR by mobile phones
- Possibility for real-time monitoring and editing of the gameplay /scenario injection/
 
#### I Chapter: The Voyagers
Where users can explore the solar system and have access to limited missions /sandbox for the next chapter/ 

#### II Chapter: The Prospectors
Where users can also claim land, dig its resources, build multi-part objects and do limited trade of them /sandbox for the next chapter/

#### III Chapter:The Merchants
Where users can buy, lend and sell what they want in near-real economy 

#### IV Chapter: Infinity
- Warp drive invention to explore the Milky Way galaxy and beyond. 


Further sophistication will be covered in Whitepaper.
