# Manifesto /WIP/
### To set the intentions    

**Long story short**:  
*We want to **turn the [crypto] game around** /pun intended/*
  
By regaining some cutting-edge technologies' true purpose, we are making a self-sustained virtual environment aka **SpaceXpanse Multiverse** where one can communicate, develop and entertain himself and which can be easily accessed by everyone from everywhere. It is a next-gen trustless blockchain platform, made for quick creation of metaverses, immersive user experience and convenient development of complex decentralized applications.

## SpaceXpanse Multiverse aka SpeX platform environment: 

### Technologies 
**ROD Blockchain**  
Open source  
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*
- Creation, storage and transaction of the main currency /**ROD**/, fungible and nonfungible tokens /NFTs/
- Digital IDs and other information, stored in the blockchain
- Decentralized DNS /derived from Namecoin/ which can serve **.rod** and/or other domains /TBD/

**SpeXQL** -  Decentralized blockchain database  
Open source  
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*  
- Implemented through Decentralized Proof of Stake aka DPoS masternodes and peer-to-peers data miners which can store both platform's data and files /public and private/
  
**Side Channels**  
Open source   
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*  
- Programable trustless interconnection **inside** the blockchain between two or more parties through temporarily made sidechains

### Development  
**SpaceXpanse Metaverse Simulator** - A playground for testing different environments, tools and objects in the platform  
Open source  
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*

- Real-time realistic solar system with major celestial bodies, terrains and environment
- Gravitational and other forces, affecting all objects accordingly /physics/
- Fast rendering with realistic level of detail
- Creation and editing of multi-part and multi-seated usable objects
- Python API for modeling of scientific inquiries
- Scenario programing /Lua/ 
- Node-based programming logic /like UE5/
- Easy adding of new solar systems, planets and satellites

**SpeXID** - Digital Identification 
Open source  
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*  
- An application built on top of the blockchain, that turns each reserved name into a secure digital identity similar to NameID  

**Democrit** - Atomic trading  
Open source   
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*  
- A protocol and system for executing atomic trades on the **SpaceXpanse Multiverse** platform. This allows players to trade their game assets for cryptocurrency (rOD) in a fully trustless manner.

**Different develoment tools /TBA/**  
Open source  
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*  
- Programable trustless interconnection **between** the blockchain and third-party applications to help developers have useful environment for effortless creation of metaverses and/or DApps in the platform  

### Community

**MetaLog** - Decentarized Social Network  
Open source  
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*
- Full-blown social network in the blockchain, usable within every platform's metaverse and/or DApp, using **SpeXQL** to store user's private data and **ROD bockchain** for user's public data.

**MetaDAO** - Decentralized Autonomous Organisation 
Open source  
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*
- Full-blown application to serve as crowdfunding hub for user's projects within the platform and more

### Entertainment  
**SpaceXpanse: Wanderers** - A space exploration game in its own metaverse  
Closed-source  
*For-profit - Legal entity operated*  
Real-time Massive Multiplayer Open World Sandbox game with realistic look, physics and economics  
- Developed on top of **SpaceXpanse Metaverse Simulator** with the help from various development tools /TBA/. 
- Partly closed source /for GSP and game logic only/
- Made with **Unreal Engine 5** <!-- and Vulcan -->
- In-game communication in real time /through **MetaLog**/
- Creation and customization of avatars
- Voice-activated commands
- NFTs for ownership of land, objects and goods
- Massive near-real economy
- Decentralized AIs for automatization of the game play <!-- : NPCs, mining, defence, navigation and communication --> /TBD/
- VR gameplay <!-- for mobile phones -->
<!-- - Possibility for real-time monitoring and customization of story arcs /scenario injection/

Where users can explore the solar system and have access to limited missions /sandbox for the next chapter/ 

***The Prospectors Chapter***  
Where users can also claim land, dig its resources, build multi-part objects and do limited trade with them /sandbox for the next chapter/

***The Merchants Chapter***  
Where users can also buy, lend and sell what they want in near-real economy 

***Infinity Chapter***
