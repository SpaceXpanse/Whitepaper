# Manifesto /WIP/
### To set the intentions    

>I think that the crypto industry will have to take a more focused approach, shifting from hype cycles toward building real utility.  
 Rahul Advani  - Rippleâ€™s APAC Policy Director

**Long story short**:  
*We want to **turn the [crypto] game around** /pun intended/* <!-- First we wanted to create a great game, now we want to change the world-->
  
By regaining some cutting-edge technologies' true purpose, we are making a self-sustained virtual environment aka **SpaceXpanse Multiverse** where one can communicate, develop and entertain himself and which can be easily accessed by everyone from everywhere. It is a next-gen trustless blockchain platform, made for quick creation of metaverses, immersive user experience and convenient development of complex decentralized applications.

## SpaceXpanse Multiverse /SpeX/ platform environment: 

### Technologies 
[**ROD Blockchain**](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/rod-core-wallet/tree/0.6.8/doc/spacexpanse)  
Open source  
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*
- Main cryptocurrency /**ROD**/, [fungible](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/rod-core-wallet/blob/0.6.8/doc/spacexpanse/currencies.md) and [nonfungible](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/libspex/tree/dev/nonfungible) tokens /NFTs/ - creation, storage and transaction
- Decentralized DNS aka **dDNS** /derived from Namecoin/ which can serve **.rod** and/or other domains /TBD/
- [Digital IDs](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/rod-core-wallet/blob/0.6.8/doc/spacexpanse/blockchain.md#names) which can hold and transfer value in the ROD blockchain
- Secure [storage of data](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/rod-core-wallet/blob/0.6.8/doc/spacexpanse/blockchain.md#spacexpanse-is-based-on-namecoin-) in the blockchain **itself**.
- Decentralized Proof of Stake aka **DPoS** masternodes and peer-to-peer nodes for secure data storage **outside** blockchain by using SQLite /or other/ database engine /TBD/
- [Atomic trading](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/rod-core-wallet/blob/0.6.8/doc/spacexpanse/trading.md) to exchange in-game assets (fungible game currencies as well as non-fungible items) in a trustless manner.
- [Human mining](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/rod-core-wallet/blob/0.6.8/doc/spacexpanse/games.md#moves-) aka **PlayToEarn** model which allows parts of the mined block rewards to be "placed" inside an application, game or other, where users can pick/win them up and bank them to their on-chain address. /TBD/  

[**SpeXQL**](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/SpeXQL) -  Decentralized database management system using ROD blockchain as medium for data transfer, interconnection and operations  
Open source  
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*  
- Implemented using both DPoS masternodes as Block Producers and peer-to-peer data storage nodes as Data Miners and which can store platform's data and files /public and private/
  
[**Side Channels**](https://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/15)  
Open source   
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*  
- Programable trustless interconnection **inside** the blockchain between two or more parties through temporarily made sidechains

### Development  
[**SpaceXpanse Metaverse Simulator**](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/Metaverse) - A playground for testing different environments, tools and objects in the platform  
Open source  
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*

- Real-time realistic solar system with major celestial bodies, terrains and environment
- Gravitational and other forces, affecting all objects accordingly /physics/
- Fast rendering with realistic level of detail
- Creation and editing of multi-part and multi-seated usable objects
- Python API for modeling of mathematical and other scientific inquiries /TBD/
- Scenario and other programing through Lua - lightweight, embeddable programming language designed for scripting and extensibility
- Support for Universal Scene Description /USD/ for collaboratively building animated 3D sceneries, intended for large-scale film and visual effects production. /TBC/ 
- Node-based programming logic /like UE5/ /TBD/
- Easy adding and editing of new solar systems, planets and satellites and other objects

[**SpeXID**](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/SpeXID) - Digital Identification for SpaceXpanse Multiverse platform   
Open source  
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*  
- An application built on top of the blockchain, that turns each reserved name into a secure digital identity similar to NameID  

<!-- **Democrit** - Atomic trading  
Open source   
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*  
- A protocol and system for executing atomic trades on the **SpaceXpanse Multiverse** platform. This allows players to trade their game assets for the main cryptocurrency /**ROD**/ and/or tokens in a fully trustless manner.
-->
**SpeX Library**  
Open source  
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*  
- Programable trustless interconnection **between** the blockchain and third-party applications to help developers have useful environment for effortless creation of metaverses and/or DApps in the platform  

### Community

**MetaLog** - Decentarized Social Network  
Open source  
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*
- Full-blown platform-wide social network in the blockchain, usable within every platform's metaverse and/or DApp, using **SpeXQL** to store user's private data and **ROD bockchain** for user's public data.

**SpeXDAO** - Decentralized Autonomous Organisation /TBD/   
Open source    
*Non-profit - Foundation operated*
- Full-blown platform-wide application in the blockchain to serve as crowdfunding hub for user's projects within the platform and more

### Entertainment  
**SpaceXpanse: Wanderers** - A space exploration game in its own metaverse /TBD/    
Closed-source  
*For-profit - Legal entity operated*  
Real-time Massive Multiplayer Open World Sandbox game with realistic look, physics and economics  
- Developed on top of **SpaceXpanse Metaverse Simulator** with the help from various development tools /TBA/. 
- Partly closed source /for GSP and game logic only/
- Made with **Unreal Engine 5** <!-- and Vulcan -->
- In-game communication in real time /through **MetaLog**/

- NFTs for ownership of land, objects and goods
- Massive near-real economy
- <!-- Decentralized --> Artificial inteligence and machine learning for automation of the gameplay <!-- : NPCs, mining, defence, navigation and communication --> /TBD/
- A possibility for VR gameplay <!-- for mobile phones. XR too -->
<!-- - A possibility for real-time monitoring and customization of story arcs /scenario injection/ -->
<!-- - Enable users to fund projects like custom-made objects through **MetaDAO** -->
